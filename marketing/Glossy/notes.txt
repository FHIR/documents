suggestions welcome for the kind of stuff I should mention
[10:32:16 AM] Grahame Grieve: I'm going to do the copy, and HL7 staff are going to finish it
[10:44:01 AM] David Hay: ease / speed of implementation has to be right up there of course
[10:44:12 AM] David Hay: building on existing stuff is also important
[10:44:38 AM] David Hay: able to co-exist with other standards - esp interop between CDA and FHIR docs
[10:45:26 AM] David Hay: evolutionary rather than revolutionary (they don't like TOO much change!)
[10:46:08 AM] David Hay: wide interest form many different organizations - SDO, vendor, clincial establishment
[10:46:51 AM] David Hay: on-line 'stuff' (can't use resource) - hyperlinked spec, samples, demo servers
[10:48:01 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: Reference implementations
[10:54:03 AM] David Hay: libraries in development...
[10:54:41 AM] David Hay: standards use (so toolkits available) - XML, JSON, Atom, HTTP
[10:55:25 AM] David Hay: mobile friendly (and add OAuth to the list of other standards)
[11:21:24 AM] Andy Stechishin: Aimed at modern Web Developers
[11:23:00 AM] Lloyd McKenzie: Multiple developers have had simple interfaces up and running in less than a day
[2:07:52 PM] Grahame Grieve: thanks everyone

Btw - if you haven't finished the text for the himss brochure, you might also want to mention that the FHIR specs can be understood - at least at the high level - by domain experts like clinicians. Try that with v2/v3/cda!



CIO / Clinician


What is FHIR
 - acronym
 - new specification
 - scalable simple web api
 - same reasons the web love it, applies to enterprise 
 
Why it is better

Exhchanging clinical and administrative information is hard. No one can afford to get the inforamtion they want it when and where they want it. The existing standards aren't helping - the best you can hope for is to get things sort of working

 - focused on implementation - fast
 - builds on existing knowledge, but makes it available
 - co-exist with other approaches
 - open license, online
 - mobile friendly
 - free clinical information : specification GET OUT OF THE WAY


Implementation
 - connectathon (open, invited)
 - result in <1 day



Where it is at 
 - draft - but implementation focused
 - released for DSTU late 2013 early 2014
 - Work towards normative 2016
