	<h2>FHIR R4 Official v4.0.0 TestScript - Execution Details</h2>
	<h3>Conventions Used</h3>
	<p>
		The execution of the TestScript resources contained in this folder are constrained by the following
		conventions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Fixtures</b> - All resource reference values can be either url paths or local local file system
			paths. The convention for these TestScript resources use local file system paths where the
			execution engine is expected to resolve this path based on the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Leading '/' character - this is resolved as an absolute path based on a known root path
				</li>
				<li>
					No leading '/' character - this is resolved as a relative path based on the location of the
					TestScript resource file
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>FHIR Connectathon 20 - San Antonio, TX - January 2019</h2>
	<h3>Terminology Services Test Track - Formal</h3>
	<p>
		The TestScript resources in this folder represent an evolution** of the TestScript originally used at the
		1st Terminology Services Connectathon held in Washington, February 2014 and then subsequently expanded
		upon since the FHIR Connectathon 10 event in Atlanta, GA.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current TestScript definitions have been separated into format and operation specific folders.
	</p>
	<p>
		All required ValueSet and ConceptMap test data resources are expected to be pre-loaded into the FHIR Terminology
		server's repository.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main reasons for this separation are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The current TestScript definition no longer contains the &lt;suite&gt; element. Without the &lt;suite&gt; element
			as a grouping mechanism it made more sense to to break up the tests into separate TestScripts.
		</li>
		<li>
			The overall separation of the original suite of tests into separate TestScript resources allows for finer
			execution control.
		</li>
		<li>
			The &lt;setup&gt; from the original TestScript definition has been removed from each of the new TestScript resources
			in favor of introducing the pre-requisite requirement that the Terminology Server under test already contain / host
			the various ValueSet, CodeSystem and ConceptMap resource instances needed by the TestScripts.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Supported Formats</h3>
	<div style="margin-left: 50px">
		<h4>JSON Format</h4>
		<p>
			The 'JSON Format' folder contains the TestScripts and Fixtures that support all operations executed using the JSON
			(Javascript Object Notation) syntax.
		</p>
		<h4>XML Format</h4>
		<p>
			The 'XML Format' folder contains the TestScripts and Fixtures that support all operations executed using the XML
			(Extensible Markup Language) syntax.
		</p>
