        <b>comments</b>: Salmonella gastrointestinal infections usually resolve in 5-7 days and most do not require treatment other than oral fluids. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration with intravenous fluids. Antibiotic therapy can prolong the duration of excretion of non-typhoidal Salmonella and is recommended only for patients with severe illness (e.g., those with severe diarrhea, high fever, bloodstream infection, or who need hospitalization) or those at risk of severe disease or complications, including young infants, older adults (over 65 years old) and immunocompromised persons. Antibiotic resistance is increasing among some Salmonella bacteria; therefore, susceptibility testing can help guide appropriate therapy. Choices for antibiotic therapy for severe infections include fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and ampicillin (for susceptible infections).</p>

  <!--    In FHIR, units may be represented twice. Once in the    agreed human representation, and once in a coded form.    Both is best, since it's not always possible to infer    one from the other in code.    When a computable unit is provided, UCUM (http://unitsofmeasure.org)    is always preferred, but it doesn't provide notional units (such as    "tablet"), etc. For these, something else is required (e.g. Snomed-CT)      -->
