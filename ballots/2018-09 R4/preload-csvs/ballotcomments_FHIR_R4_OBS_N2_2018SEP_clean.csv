HL7 v2.8 supports both numerical array (NA) and multiplexed arrays. It is not clear how this is supported in FHIR. This sort of data is good for capturing information over time and other dimensions whose primary factors are in common. (There may be a way of doing this through multiple resource instances, but that could cause significant overhead in high frequency measurements.). It is possible that a numeric array may be addressed as described in 10.1.4.3.2 Observation.component, but that is not clear, not does it seem to address multiplexed arrays.

e.g.: Observation.code = 49134-0 Glucose [Mass/?volume] in Blood 2 hours post dose glucose

Alternatively, use code translations in Observation.code.

e.g.: Observation.code = coding-1: 20564-1 Oxygen saturation in Blood, coding-2: 59408-5 Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry

Another alternative is to use the precondition extension.

Observation.code = 20564-1 Oxygen saturation in Blood, Observation.value: 98%

Use a specific code, if one is available, but always provide a more general (e.g., methodless) code if available to support broader intelligibility. Include both in the coding list.

	make sure to include 2345-7 Glucose [Mass/​volume] in Serum or Plasma

b. use the same example for both points - glucose or O2.
