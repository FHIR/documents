My question is, did I interpret 42 CFR Part 2 correctly in the Summary to the right? I don't want to case a negative vote on the entire ballot as as I'm sure my question will draw a correct response from the reviewers. Thank you.
The default to the best of my knowledge is that sensitive information is restricted per 42 CFR Part 2 requiring explicit permission to share. The wording in this IG states that the payer may allow the option to restrict which is already the default case. The implication is that it would be shared otherwise.",Did I interpret 42 CFR Part 2 correctly in the Summary?,Yes,,,,,Financial Mgmt,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alberto S.

",The Provenance record or Provenance record URL MAY be sent to a Federated Provenance Store shared by authorized exchange participants to enable retrieval of Provenance Records related to a Member's records regardless of whether the authorized requester is conformant to the PDex IG.,"RE: The updated Provenance record SHALL be passed on to any downstream entity requesting the associated records.
 We are fully supportive of the comprehensive provenance requirements.
 However, there are additional use cases, which would not be supported, and understandably out of scope.
  E.g., Members' Apps and third-party actors are not in scope for requiring support for receiving and storing Provenance information, and maintaining correlations or links to the records the Provenance Record is documenting. These actors are also not required to update the Provenance record to add information covering their identities or their actions on the records, nor are they required to pass the updated Provenance record to any downstream entity requesting the associated records.  
 That said, in an effort to evolve a trusted ecosystem of exchange by leveraging Provenance Records, we suggest that in addition to being capable passing on Provenance Records to any downstream entity requesting the associated records, this IG also include an optional capability for in-scope actors to send the location of their Provenance Records to a Federated Provenance Store. This approach is described in the HL7 Privacy and Security Architecture Framework (PSAF) Volume 3 Provenance, which is being reballoted in September 2019.
 Utilizing this approach would enable downstream recipients of PDex information exchanges, as well as many other information exchanges in which Provenance Records were not conveyed, to search on keys from that information to locate any related Provenance Records (as authorized) rather than try to track that provenance by other means.
 As we see it, there is no need at this juncture to specify the architecture of such a Federated Provenance Store.  There are multiple approaches, including the use of Digital Ledger Technology (Blockchain).  What is important is signaling to the DaVinci and wider community that such a capability is on the horizon, and should be ""front of mind"" in terms of development and further articulation.
