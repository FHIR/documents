8,Immunization Forecast CDS,,Use Cases,,,,,(NA),http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/immds/2019SEP/usecases.html,A-Q,,,,,How should an immunization CDS engine respond if the patient or immunization information had logic errors that prevented calculating a proper response? For example if the administration date for the immunization was before the birth of the patient or the vaccination code was not recognized by the receiving system? In these cases it might not be possible to produce a sensible result or the result may be missing critical information. How does the server signal properly to the requestor that it was unable to respond and the reason why?

14,Immunization Forecast CDS,,,,,,,(NA),,NEG,Correction,,,,"1) In http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/immds/2019SEP/OperationDefinition-immds-forecast-operation.html, the ImmunizationRecommendation link points to the Immunization resource, not the ImmunizationRecommendation resource

2) From the caller's perspective, it appears that specifying immunity would be specified in the Immunization resource by using a ""fake"" CVX code for a vaccine and say, ""this is the vaccine that targets the disease that the patient is immune to"". There are SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM codes which could be used to specify immunity and keep these elements conceptually different.

3) The reason codes (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-immunization-evaluation-dose-status-reason.html) are: adverse storage condition, cold chain break, expired lot, administered outside schedule, product recall. All of these (except administered outside schedule) aren't things that a CDS engine would return to the caller; it's something the caller would pass up to the CDS engine. So having this as a part of ImmunizationEvaluation does not make sense.","Correct link in operation rendering, targetDisease should be bound to SNOMED CT, ImmunizationEvaluation reason codes don't make sense",,,,,,Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,,Daryl Chertcoff ,"HLN Consulting, LLC ",,daryl@hln.com ,,,,,,
15,,,,,,,,(NA),,A-C,,,,,"While CDS support for immunizations is helpful to patient and clinician, a higher priority should be accurate and easier transfer of immunization records including vaccines provided at pharmacies, schools, nursing homes, etc.  Inaccurate or records will complicate CDS recommendations.
