1,US QI Core,,,,,,,(NA),,NEG,Clarification,,,,"Not clear if/how provenance is represented in this FHIR Implementation Guide.  Provenance (who, what, when, where, why) is essential at:  1) point of origination (at the source, for newly captured content), 2) point of update (for newly updated content, preserving previous content and its provenance).

Who = subject of care/information (typically the patient)
Who = performer of action taken
Who = author of information captured or updated
Who = organization
What = action taken
When = date/time of action taken
When = date/time of information capture or update
Where = physical location of action taken
Where = physical location of information capture or update
Where = network address and/or device ID where information captured or updated
Why = rationale, purpose of action taken
Why = rationale, purpose of information capture or update

Granularity of provenance (e.g., binding authorship to content) may be at the dataset or element level.

5,US QI Core,,1.2.0,,,,,(NA),http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/2019SEP/index.html,A-C,,,"This initiative began in 2013 with the creation of the Quality Improvement Domain Analysis Model (QIDAM), which drew on the vMR and QDM as sources of requirements. QIDAM gave rise to the QUICK logical model in 2014. Originally, QUICK was entirely independent of FHIR. However, recognizing the broader community focus on FHIR, QUICK was aligned, structurally and semantically, as closely as possible to FHIR. This alignment not only creates a common model for quality and interoperability, but will also make it easier in the future to leverage other FHIR-related efforts, such as Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) on FHIR. The conceptual, logical, and physical models in this initiative are, respectively, QIDAM, QUICK, and the QI-Core FHIR Profiles.",,"This statement is not entirely accurate. The original QUICK model did derive from QIDAM and was relatively independent of FHIR. However, the model was not subsequently aligned to FHIR. Rather, a set of QI Core profiles were developed directly on FHIR and the QUICK model instead became the logical view derived from the corresponding FHIR profiles. This is an important difference, which is important to remember as we are now discussing the QUICK logical model as a model that would derive from the QDM and QIDAM, a model closely aligned to FHIR, from which QI Core profiles would be derived. The directionality of the derivation is important especially for upcoming modeling discussions.

Note that later in the document, the authors state that: ""Using FHIR to define the QUICK logical model seems to reverse the usual flow from conceptual model to logical model to physical model. This is true, and has been the source of some controversy. Without revisiting that debate, the bottom line is whether the QUICK model has the right set of objects and attributes that are needed for quality improvement applications. To assure that QUICK does meet those requirements, the QI-Core profiles were created. QI-Core fills any gaps such as missing attributes and unspecified value sets that might make QUICK insufficient for quality improvement applications. In turn, QUICK is derived from QI-Core profiles, rather than directly from FHIR, providing an author-focused view of the FHIR resources profiled by QI-Core.""",Correct QICore background statement,,,,,,Clinical Quality Information,,,,,,,,,,,,,Claude Nanjo ,,,cnanjo@gmail.com ,,,,,,
