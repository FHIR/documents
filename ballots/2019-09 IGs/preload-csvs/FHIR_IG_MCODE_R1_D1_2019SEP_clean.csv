Consider how to create a profile that is profiled from both the CG WG profile and the US Core profile. Easiest maybe to add elements of US-core to CG WG profile. Refer to the FMG on how to create  a merged profile. This is an important problem for this group that makes it hard to create an interoperable standard - the CG WG has components which cannot be taken out of the context of the profile they are a part of. The US-core extensions found in US-core observation are defined independently of the observation they are in. That is the US-core extensions should be addable to a profile off of the CG WG profile that contains the necessary components. The extensions are more like independent data elements, whereas the components are not. Please seek guidance from the FMG or technical resources to ensure that the statements are technically accurate.  Trying to use both profiles as sources is difficult.

A valueset of LOINC codes helps the implementor. However, would consider consulting with BRIDGE on the way to express a biomarker computably, if the goal is to use the profile outside the context of oncology reporting. The valueset will need a steward and should be accessible, consider VSAC depending on use case. If the profile is not proprietary and is meant to be used in regulated reporting then VSAC would be highly appropriate. Again, there is a maintence cost to using precoordinated terminology to provide identification of the biomarker. Is there a biomarker naming authority in oncology? Would incorporating the GENE name or a reference to variantTested be useful. It is a big ask to create a robust universal biomarker profile. I can see why you would use the value set. However, the name of the biomarker, associated gene if one exists, etc... are descriptive fields that can allow for post-coordination. I do not know how much to press here. The use case is oncology reporting to tumor registries, this is secondary to clinical practice so having to use a valueset and needing to write logic to determine if the biomarker is a protein or substance may not be a major issue for implementors of clinical research systems. The problem arises when we have a genomic variant test that could be used as a biomarker finding or more discretely.
