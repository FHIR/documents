3,Clinical Guidelines,,,,,,,(NA),,A-S,Enhancement,,,,"Perhaps it would be wise to include practicing clinicians as ""end users (e.g., clinical implementation team representatives, health IT developers, patients/patient advocates)"" since they would be the ones presented with the guideline recommendations and implementation may impact patient-clinician relationship and clinician burden.
There should also be an ongoing feedback loop from the field back to the development/implement cycle.  This is present in figure 2, but should be considered in process of figure 1.
CodeSystem-cpg-indicator: ""Indicates that the recommendation is critical and the workflow should not be allowed to proceed"" > when implemented, clinicians must not be blocked from their workflow - implementers should indicate level of concern and provide alternate pathway rather than workflow lock up (ie do not allow a hidden window to stop workflow).
CQL code - need to consider microalbumin result value as text ""too low to detect"" or null with comment field in following example:
define ""Last UACR Quantity"":
  ""Last UACR Lab Result"" Result
    return ToQuantity(Result.value as Quantity)
Recommendations should be brief and concise in pop up card but expandable for further detail to reduce interruption to clinical workflow.
Ideally, recommended actions should be capable of generating selectable order set.",**website comment** - End users,,,,,,Clinical Decision Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,Peter Muir ,PjmConsultingLlc.com ,,Peter@PjmConsultingLlc.com ,,,,,,
