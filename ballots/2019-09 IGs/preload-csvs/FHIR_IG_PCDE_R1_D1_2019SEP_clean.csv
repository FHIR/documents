5,US Da Vinci PCDE,,,,,,,(profiles),,NEG,Clarification,,,,"Several comments:
1. LOINC has long been the accepted terminology system for document and section codes in HL7.  Requesting codes from LOINC for a specific purpose is not challenging.  I would prefer the document and section codes use LOINC so that we have fewer vocabularies to reference for document ontology.

PCDex seems to be missing a case of how this would be handled using existing technology, or a description of how the proposed solution would impact user workflows, or perhaps even a description of who those users are and what their current workflows are.  Again, it shows some variance from other Da Vinci specifications.",Use LONIC codes where possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Keith Boone MBI ,Audacious Inquiry ,,kboone@ainq.com ,,,,,,
