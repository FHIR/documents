We'll also probably want to require ""scope"" to be populated. And the UDAP spec does not state any preferences as to how the private key used to sign the JWT used to authenticate with the token endpoint should be communicated. This should probably be the jwks_uri preferred to the jwks to match Bulk FHIR's guidance (even though Bulk FHIR isn't in scope, UDAP forces all clients to be confidential and to use JWT authentication, so we'll have to use jwks_uri and/or jwks regardless of whether Bulk FHIR is in scope or not).
