PID-8 is ""Administrative Sex"" which is not the same as birth sex.  ""Administrative Sex"" is used for administrative purposes such as inpatient bed assignment and billing/claims processing.  

Accurate Birth sex is critical for laboratory result reporting and in V2  and V3 should be reported as a clinical observation.  PID-8 was originally (up until V2.4) titled ""Sex"" but the field  title was clarified for harmonization when HL7 Version 3 differentiated the concepts of ""administrative gender"" defined as ""The gender of a person used for administrative purposes (as opposed to clinical gender)"" thus creating two distinct concepts.  

-

Suggest working with Patient Administration to determine whether it is possible to clarify the definition of V2 PID-8 to include Birth Sex, but since V2 is normative and per ANSI, has to be backward compatible this may not be possible.  

Another alternative is to add a new field to the V2 PID segment to capture Birth Sex. ",Add mapping or new field to V2 to support birth sex,,,,,FHIR Infrastructure,,,,,,,,,,,,,Freida Hall ,Quest Diagnostics ,Freida Hall ,freida.x.hall@questdiagnostics.com ,,,,
