Accurate Birth sex is critical for laboratory result reporting and in V2  and V3 should be reported as a clinical observation.  PID-8 was originally (up until V2.4) titled ""Sex"" but the field  title was clarified for harmonization when HL7 Version 3 differentiated the concepts of ""administrative gender"" defined as ""The gender of a person used for administrative purposes (as opposed to clinical gender)"" thus creating two distinct concepts.  

Suggest working with Patient Administration to determine whether it is possible to clarify the definition of V2 PID-8 to include Birth Sex, but since V2 is normative and per ANSI, has to be backward compatible this may not be possible.

According to HCS, there should be 0..1 Security Label on any portion of content to which a Security Label must be applied per policy.  A Security Label is the syntactic structure defined in multiple ISO and ITEF standards, in the HCS for specific healthcare labeling rules, and by NIST specifications.  A Security Label is comprised on security label fields, which are valued with appropriate privacy and handling caveat tags.  Therefore, there can only be one Security Label.  Unfortunately, FHIR has misnamed Security Label Fields a s Security Labels. 
*The Consent.except.securityLabel comment discusses a ""high water mark"", which makes no sense in the context of a Consent.except.securityLabel.  The Consent.except.securityLabel represents the policy rules in this Consent Directive that pertain to particular types or instances of information governed under that rule.  If information governed by the Consent Directive  merges more than one consent policy, then there must be more than one Consent.except that specifies the information that each policy rules governs, even if the Consent.except.actor and Consent.except.action are the same.  This includes any Consent.except.data.meaning inclusion of associated resources.  I.e., if prior to the construction of the Consent.except, the Consent.except.data.meaning is comprised of information governed under more than one consent policy, e.g., an episode of care, when the Consent.except are assembled, that bundle of Consent.except.data must be broken up into sets governed by each consent policy.  
*For example, the VA Form 10-0485 consent directive type allows a veteran to opt-in for disclosure on eHealth Exchange for all HIPAA and Title 38 Section 7332 consent policies.  This is a ""basic opt-in"" Consent Directive. However, because it includes more than one consent policy and because of how the FHIR Consent is structured, there would be no Consent.securityLabel, and there would be two Consent.except, one for HIPAA and one for Title 38 governed information even if type of information governed under these consent policies includes the veteran's entire medical record being disclosed by the VA.  The Consent.except for HIPAA governed information would have a Consent.except.securityLabel that includes at a minimum  the Confidentiality Security Label field valued as ""normal"" and 1..* allowable HIPAA POUs .  The Consent.except for Title 38 governed information would have a Consent.except.securityLabel that includes the Confidentiality Security Label field valued as ""restricted"", all Title 38 pertinent Sensitivity Security Label fields - i.e., {HIV, ETH, SCA}, eHealth Exchange allowed POUs, and the Refrain Security Label field prohibiting redisclosure without consent.  There would be no high water mark.  No Consent Directive should contain a policy rule encoded with a Security Label representing a high water mark for the governed information.  However, the Consent Directive itself should be assigned a Security Label, which would reflect the high water mark for all the protected information governed by that directive.

",Needs to be remodeled.

*No specified information that it is permitted to perform these operations on;
*A role that limits it to receiving information only, i.e., a role that is not permitted to do any other privacy action;

*""Meaning if Missing: There is no specific actor who is the focus of the consent"" makes no sense.  There must be at least one consent grantee even if its everyone in the universe.

Consent Policy is called “policy context” and is defined as “Any organizational or jurisdictional policies, which may limit the consumer’s policy choices, and which includes the named range of actions allowed.”  The definition is ok if it included a healthcare consumer’s policies”, which would be the healthcare consumer’s policy choices if the consumer were on an equal footing to negotiate the Consent Directive, which a consumer is able to do to a large extent with respect to a PHR.  However, this is not a “context” as in milieu of social norms; it is a specific set of policies, which must be explicitly acknowledged in the Consent Directive in order for it to count as an informed consent.
 
Consent Directive is adequately defined, but not used in the explanatory text where is should be.  Instead the term ""consent"", ""privacy statement"", and ""Consent Statement"" are used as if synonymous. 
 
The undefined term ""Consent Statement"" is used throughout the front matter but it's meaning is unclear because its usage overlaps with other consent concepts.  In section 6.4.1.1 this term is first used in the statement: ""It may be used to represent the Privacy Consent Directive itself, or a derived consent statement that is not the original Consent Directive.""  The distinction between ""representing the Privacy Consent Directive itself"" and being a “derivative” is important because exactly the same electronic capture of a Consent Directive may be legally binding in one context and not in another, or the electronic syntax and semantics may be insufficient to convey a legally binding Consent Directive content in any case, e.g., if there is no way in which to clearly indicate the governed information or include any type of signature.  In addition, there are two types of Consent Directive derivatives, which are used for two entirely different purposes: Consent Statement, which represents a Consent Directive, but is not legally binding, and Consent Metadata, which includes the minimum necessary information necessary for a consent management workflow.
 
With respect to Consent Statements: A policy domain may accept a verbal or structured/unstructured/combination of both representative of the agreement between the grantor and grantee as constituting a Consent Directive.  Another policy domain may consider this representation insufficient.  That is the critical differentiator between a Consent Statement and a Consent Directive. 
Support for representation of signature is a good example of this differentiation. While it's true that ""Consent statements are often signed - either on paper, or digitally. Consent Signatures will be found in the Provenance resource (example consent and signature)"", only a Consent Directive is signed in a manner deemed adequate by a policy domain. For example in the State of Minnesota, which adopted the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act that typically permits electronic signatures, only a wet signature on a Healthcare Directive Form is considered an executed Consent Directive, and specific rules about witnessing of that signature apply.  According to a report to the Minnesota Legislature on the use of electronic ""Representations of Consents"", Epic Care Everywhere EHR does not permit the use of electronic signatures on its Consent Statements.  Instead, paper copies of Consent Directives with wet signatures are used.
 
The definition of a Consent Statement must also differentiate between what such a statement connotes – i.e., that it is a “representation of a Consent Directive”, and the concept of Consent Metadata.  From the context of its use in the front matter, Consent Statement is described as an electronic representation that has less than full fidelity with a legally binding Consent Directive from which it was ""transcribed"". Consent Statements may be ""lossy"" due to the inability of the specification to support certain concepts or by design, reduced in contextual content to minimize transaction size of computable content, which humans are not expected to understand.  
 
This contrasts with Consent Metadata, which is a purposely truncated subset of information ""derived"" from a Consent Directive. Consent Metadata is constrained to the minimum that the requester ""needs to know"" to manage a specific type of consent workflow, such as simply confirming authorization to share information governed by a consent directive with a particular party.  Or it can be as robust as to include all Consent Metadata needed for all consent management workflows, which is typically provided when a custodian registers information about a Consent Directive it obtains and manages.
 
For example, a transcribed Consent Form such as represented with a v2 CON segment, may capture most but not all of the content of a Consent Directive, and may or may not be deemed sufficient to be legally binding; nevertheless, it may still contain more sensitive information than should be sent in a Consent Metadata exchange intended simply to trigger workflow. This idea is stated in the front matter, but attributed to Consent Statement and not Consent Metadata.
 
Consent management - particularly privacy consent - is complicated by the fact that consent to share is often itself necessary to protect. The need to protect the privacy of the privacy statement itself competes with the execution of the consent statement. For this reason, it is common to deal with 'consent statements' that are only partial representations of the full consent statement that the patient provided.

This ""entire code system"" is far from a complete set, and even the example consent directive value set was more complete.  This value set includes statuses that are not appropriate to all of the ways in which the content of the FHIR Consent is intended to be used - i.e., as a Consent Directive, a Consent Statement, or Consent Metadata.  
*""Draft"" never applies to Consent Directive, Consent Statement or Consent Metadata  It only pertains to a Consent Form used for capturing the intentions of the parties to a Consent Directive.  A Consent Directive may have the status of ""policy"", which represents the consent policy in a domain.  (A draft Consent Form should be a profile on FHIR Questionnaire with Patient Friendly terms, and the completed form would be captured with a FHIR Questionnaire response, which would be used to populate a FHIR Consent, where the usage is either as a Consent Directive, Consent Statement, or Consent Metadata.)
*""Proposed"" only pertains to a Consent Directive signed by one of the parties, but not yet signed or agreed to by the other party, e.g., when a provider presents a Consent Form to a consumer and asks if the consumer will ""fill it out"" by either signing as in an opt-in basic consent directive or by selecting any restrictions the provider's offered Consent Form allows the consumer to make.  The same is true when a consumer requests a Consent Form to opt-out of a default opt-in ""implied"" Consent Directive. Another example is when a consumer requests additional restrictions to a default opt-in ""implied"" Consent Directive such as a HIPAA Consent Directive.  This is the negotiation phase during which either party may decline to execute the proposed Consent Directive.  
*""Active"" only pertains to a Consent Directive, but may be conveyed  as the status of a Consent Directive in a Consent Statement or Consent Metadata if the Consent Resource usage is flagged.  This is a missing element in the Resource, and another comment argues that it needs to be added.
*""Rejected"" only makes sense as a state transition from the status ""proposed"" when one or both parties cannot reach consensus on the terms of a Consent Directive.  Rejected status may be conveyed as the status of a Consent Directive in a Consent Statement or Consent Metadata if the Consent Resource is appropriately flagged for one of these two uses.
*""Inactive"" conflates four statuses - expiration, cancellation (because one or both parties failed to comply), updated, and revoked, because one or both parties changes their mind about the agreement - not equivalent to cancellation.
*""Entered-in-error"" needs to specify whether the referenced consent content is a Consent Directive, Consent Statement, or Consent Metadata as any of the three could be entered in error.
*Missing statuses crucial to consent management where the referenced content is a Consent Directive, but which may be conveyed in a Consent Statement or Metadata, include: 
*""Policy"", which represents the consent policy in a domain, but is not executeable, e.g., regulatory description of the required content in a compliant Consent Directive;  
*""Expired"", which is the state of a Consent Directive once the expiry date of the Consent Directive is reached; 
*""Amended"", which is the state of a Consent Directive in which content is either updated/revised because content was removed or added;
*""Appended"", which is the state of a Consent Directive in which additional content is attached without altering the existing content,, e.g., the Consent Form reference is added or its representation as a computable rule, unstructured text or image, or another  structured format is attached.
*""Replaced"", which is the state of a Consent Directive that has not reach expiry date is deprecated, but not revoked, and a new version is submitted without changing the date upon which it will expire, e.g., if the consumer is diagnosed with a condition for which the consumer previously agreed to share but now wants to restrict for all POUs, actions, and recipients; 
*""Disputed"", which is the state of a Consent Directive that is in effect, and one of the parties raises issue e.g., with the way in which the other party is interpreting the terms or there is allegation of non-compliance, e.g., a consumer claims that a disclosure made by the grantee constitues a breach. 
*""Revoked"", which is the state of a Consent Directive after a grantor consumer has rescinded the consumer's agreement with the rights conveyed to the grantee in the Consent Directive.  In some policy domains, there are limitation on retrospective revocation, such as HIPAA, which does not permit the revocation to impact the grantee's rights exercised prior to the revocation, i.e., a provider may continue reimbursement and reporting activities triggered by actions previous to the revocation.  In other policy domains such as US COPPA and EU GDPR, revocation may trigger ""the right to be forgotten"", which could result in a claw-back of all grantee's rights over data governed under the Consent Directive, which has been revoked.

When designing a system to authorize access to information, all potential access methods must be considered. They include the following:

·         Search
o    Chained search provides the ability to disclose information on related resources. A security implementation must consider whether a client has the permission to access the resource being searched on, as well as the chained resource(s)
o    _include and _revinclude search parameters allow client to request related resources. A security implementation must determine if the client has access to the included resources.
·         Security Labels (see section 6.1.1)
·         Several resources, including Bundle, Composition, Group and List, are designed to contain other resources. A security implementation should consider whether access to an individual resource, such as a Bundle, should permit access to all resources contained within the resource.
·         FHIR defines several operations that may be supported by a server. Security implementations must evaluate whether a client has the ability to invoke these operations and what information should be returned from them. Fetch Encounter Record, Evaluate Measure, Observation Statistics, Find patient matches using MPI based logic and Fetch Patient Record specifically provide the ability to disclose patient information.
·         Batch and transaction processing provide ways for clients to create and update information in bulk. Security implementations should consider whether a client has the ability to initiate one of these interactions and make authorization decisions on each action in the batch/transaction.

This can cause further issues when multiple parameters are used.

In this case, ""code-value-quantity"" might be a better choice, but component parameters don't exist for all possible couplings.

FHIR is intended to support sharing data in a computable manner. I.e. The information shared should be useable for computer-mediated processes such as decision support, rules triggering, trend analysis, etc. However, not every system is the same and not all systems are able to recognize all discrete data. Also, there is still considerable value in data exchange in circumstances where not all or even none of that data is captured in a discrete manner. For this reason, FHIR resources support sharing not only discrete data for computation, but also a human-readable view so that the humans on each end of a healthcare information exchange can still get a full picture of what's going on. 

Narrative is expected to exist for most resource instances, although it can be omitted in a few limited circumstances. In some cases the narrative will be generated from discrete information. ... In other cases, the narrative might be free-form text commentary entered directly by a practitioner such as referral letters, pathology reports, etc. Certain parts of the narrative would content could also later be exposed as discrete data. 
",,"Agree that non-discrete data provides considerable value and must be available for sharing.  However, structures and processes to drive the capture of more discrete data and less ""narrative"" data should be prioritized for the purposes mentioned (decision support, trend analysis, reporting).

In addition, in cases where data is being transmitted for secondary data usages, the receiving party may require that the data is limited to only the PII and PHI that is required for them to perform their work.  Frequently this would require that the receiving entity, such as The Joint Commission, reject files containing non-discrete data.

In many respects it could serve as a problem oriented note almost en toto.  Have not yet seen how notes are evolving so there may have been some method to the madness. Would have helped a lot to show what might be the minimum of these attributes required for a typical problem list...     

There were no examples of the kinds of codes that would actually be used, to give meaning to the purpose.

But should note that the LOINC codes are based on a model jointly developed and constructed by RadLex RSNA and LOINC. RSNA is very much behind it which will be good for its dissemination.  Like the lab LOINC codes, there is a separable structure behind the simple code and name and these are RadLex codes.  

So at present, the anatomy codes are NOT SNOMED, in part because RadLex chose a different base coding system for anatomy – think the one that is in OBO, and in part because at present SNOMED does not want to expand the domain of LOINC SNOMED cooperation beyond its current scope though we have asked.

The key thing is that some of the components that are broken out into separate attributes in this specification will be available as separable components from the LOINC code and its companion RadLex parts. The other little worry is they may not align perfectly with DICOM (just don’t know), though DICOM has been part of the collaboration.

Laboratories routinely have a variable that is summative across a series of discrete variables -- these are usually called impressions or interpretations. Sometimes they are algorithmically specified and sometimes they have the imprimatur of pathologists. They will not have any of the special attributes about starting time, or other associations; they may have an associated reader. EKG machines put out interpretations as just another calculation. Labs also produce calculations such as the eGFR, which could also be confused with a diagnostic interpretation.  There will be further confusion with assessments such as PHQ-9 which has a variable at the end that categorizes the level of depression. Some simple genetic tests make diagnosis directly. 

Think it would work better if you excluded test interpretations or found another way to narrow the definition. Think you are OK when talking about a clinician’s final judgement about a work up.

It also emphasizes the point that a variant is a function of two sequences - the sample (patient) sequence and the reference (“normal”) sequence but a variant is NOT just a sequence.

Many of the quality measures and especially the read coverages provide information that goes well beyond the variant – it must relate to the sequence that was examined – usually in a long sequencing study.  Think there are at least 4 ranges described for the coverage to apply. Really need to tie coverage down. 

The sequence variant repository items are confusing - 
It describes many things. You can report many repositories.  One would likely be the Refseq repository, another the variant ID in some pubic repository. But do not see any way to know which is which, or whether that was the intention. Or is this just intended to represent the variant found in more then one repository?

Of course, the diagnostic request resource is not the actual request (e.g., an order created in an EHR system), any more than the patient resource is the actual patient. Everything in an HIT system is a ""record of the fact that"" something exists or was done. For example, the Procedure resource says it is ""an action that is or was performed on a patient."" But it isn't really, it's actually a record that the procedure was performed. So I don't why it's important to make the point about the Diagnostic Request resource not actually being the request, but a record of the request. To be logically consistent, you'd have to make statements like that about almost all resources. 

Back to the specifics of this resource: since the request ""was made"" (past tense), then that implies that the order was placed already.
