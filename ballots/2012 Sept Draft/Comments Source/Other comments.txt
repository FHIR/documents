0.0 It is essential, in my opinion to establish early on that the difference between FHIR and "just another cute XML representation"
is the previously stated objective to bind the FHIR resources to established Health Informatics foundations.  This means,
I believe, the required mappings (as discussed when FHIR was proposed) to the HL7 RIm, plus, ISO data types (or Abstract DT R2).
While these are possible in the current document, there is no commitment in this "book" to require and establish such mappings. 
I suggest that the discussion of the FHIR Community in HL7 be extended to clearly make such a linkage.

1.1 "extensibility" bullet - "cater for" should be either "cater to" or "allow for"

1.1.1 roadmap is an excellent organizing idea BUT - the contents of the bullets (the section after the bullet "title" are BADLY mixed: about half are noun phrases (like the first three in 1.1.1.1; and the others are verb phrases (like the second three in 1.1.1.1. This makes for clumsy reading. Suggest using glossary-like noun phrases for all. 

1.2.1 I stumbled through the notes the first three times I read it trying to decide if the description was of XML elements or pseudo-XML  elements. Needs an adjective (on "element" here and there to make it clear. For instance, I believe the third bullet should begin "To build a valid instance of a resource...." and if I am wrong, this is evidence of the confusion that arises from the text. 

1.2.3 If FHIR is based on and mapped to HL7 RIM and datatypes, I believe dataAbsentReason values should be mapped to one (or set) of null favors. This should either appear here or be linked to from here. 

1.2.4 bis "class base" UML diagram. This is interesting, but there is neither a caption to it nor a reference from either 1.2.3 or 1.2.4 It dangles and probably needs some annotation

Comment:  The energy should go into v3 implementation improvements, not to another canibal in the HL7 ranks.
