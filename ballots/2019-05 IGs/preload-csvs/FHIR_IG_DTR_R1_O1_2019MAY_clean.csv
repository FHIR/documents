Da Vinci Use Cases do not take into account that the patient’s health plan information can be in Practice Management systems and not in the EHRs.  Take the DTR use case for example.  How would you know when a patient has an appointment and is a member of a specific health plan in order to invoke a CDS Hook to allow for a FHIR API to present a document or questionnaire or whatever needs to come from a health plan partner?  Even using CQL rules to try and capture what health plan a patient is a member of could prove difficult since the source of truth for claims is the Practice Management system.  We  see that as a gap and until we  are actually trying to implement one of these, we won’t know the real impact.  Even the simple 30-Day Medication Reconciliation Post-Discharge use case shows that the medication reconciliation needs to be accompanied with a claims CPT Code that may not be in the EHR. We do not hear Da Vinci meetings discuss the fact that most EHRs use a separate Practice Management system.",Practice Management data not available in EHR,,,,,,Clinical Decision Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Dixon ,,,george.dixon@allscripts.com ,,,,,,
