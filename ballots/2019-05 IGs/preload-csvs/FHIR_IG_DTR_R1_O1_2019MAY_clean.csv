Da Vinci Use Cases do not take into account that the patientâ€™s health plan information can be in Practice Management systems and not in the EHRs.  Take the DTR use case for example.  How would you know when a patient has an appointment and is a member of a specific health plan in order to invoke a CDS Hook to allow for a FHIR API to present a document or questionnaire or whatever needs to come from a health plan partner?  Even using CQL rules to try and capture what health plan a patient is a member of could prove difficult since the source of truth for claims is the Practice Management system.  We  see that as a gap and until we  are actually trying to implement one of these, we wonâ€™t know the real impact.  Even the simple 30-Day Medication Reconciliation Post-Discharge use case shows that the medication reconciliation needs to be accompanied with a claims CPT Code that may not be in the EHR. We do not hear Da Vinci meetings discuss the fact that most EHRs use a separate Practice Management system.",Practice Management data not available in EHR,,,,,,Clinical Decision Support,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Dixon ,,,george.dixon@allscripts.com ,,,,,,
