A bundled upload will contain all or several of the resources, and resources within the Bundle that reference one another can be handled using temporary ids. In addition, one can use an update transaction for the Patient and Device resources that only need to be uploaded once. The update transaction allows one to specify the logical id thus one does not have to wait for a server response. The PHG can keep a record of the logical ids for these one-time uploads and use them in the Observation resources in subsequent Bundles that now only contain Observation resources. An example of a first-time upload of a transaction bundle is given here. Alternatively, one can use conditional creates on the Patient and Device resources and include them in the Bundle every time. The conditional create assures no data duplication. However, that approach does put an extra burden on the server and does waste bandwidth.

At the current time, PHD the codes used in the measurement types and measurement values (when codes) come from the SCADA, INFRA, SITES, PHD_DM, PHD_HF, and PHD_AI partitions.
